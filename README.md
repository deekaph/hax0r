I've been into infosec since the 90s - I was a little hacker kiddie, dumpster diving at the telco, redboxing payphones to get to the DC voicebridge, beigeboxing the neighbor's house to call long distance BBSes, war dialing, all the cliches. 

Life's busy and careers in what would come to be known as "Cyber Security" didn't have a clearly defined education path (my highschool counsellor advised me to take programming, which didn't interest me too much at the time) so I studied Philosophy and Language at university and went on to work the next 13 or so years in technology sales and support for a local office equipment company.

Then one day I realized my kids were old enough that I didn't need to keep working at that job for the flexibility it had given me while the kids were young, and I was like "hey I can do anything so what do I want to do?" Obviously something more technical. Why not get paid really well for doing the stuff you enjoy doing anyway?

There's tons of certifications you can get now, and that was obviously the way for me to show my chops since a BA in Philosophy and Language isn't an obvious sign of technical prowess. For me, buying the EC Council "Certification Club" was the best bang for the buck as it includes a year of access to all of their courses as well as the exams. Theoretically, you could do every one of their certifications for the same price, and as my current position is extremely flexible I had the time to commit to doing so.

They're all inter-related - the ECES (Encryption Specialist) certification is a deeper-dive into Cryptography than Module 20 of the CEH covers. Understanding how a Forensic Investigator will look at a compromised system (CHFI) is a more rounded training than is provided in CEH Module 12 (Evasion).

Part of how I learn is by copying down notes, and these are my notes that I typed while watching the videos and sometimes while I practiced things, either in course labs or on VMs in my own home lab. Nothing was copy/pasted and there's bound to be typos. It is neither complete, nor definitive - some modules I didn't take a lot of notes in and some I pretty much copied every slide. 

I try to study every day, whether it's a self-directed lab objective ("I'm going to figure out how to network all my machines to a NFS share and then try to attack it"). Some days I'm in the lecture zone and will watch video instruction for 12 hours, taking notes and trying things out on my own VMs or on Tryhackme. The key for retention, at least for me, is to do it every day, even if I'm not feeling well or am super busy with other things.

Eventually, I needed a way to share my notes between my various desktops, laptops, VMs and so on. The more I used Github to grab scripts from, the more I realized that it's actually the perfect platform for this task, so here I am uploading it here, mainly for my own uses, but I'm going to make it a public repository and hopefully others can find some use in it as well. If you find it useful, then follow me because as I do other certs I will be adding my notes for those here as well.
